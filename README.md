# TrackList
This desktop application provides a platform for users to coordinate productivity in a group project among the group members by creating a shared To-Do List. Any group member can create a list, shared it with other users, and add tasks to the shared list. The application allows users to specify a deadline for each task and displays the amount of time remaining to deadline in the Timer Mode feature. Tasks are also personalized for users in the MyWorklist feature of the application, which displays all the tasks created by a user across all of the user's To-Do Lists. Users receive notifications when a list is shared with them, and/or when tasks are added to a project they are a part of. Users can mark tasks as completed, which sends a notification to other group members informing them of the task completion. 



Overall, this application helps groups better manage time and productivity in a project by organizing their tasks into mutually-shared lists, which helps them track group as well as individual progress on different components of the project.
